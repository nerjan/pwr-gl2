Welcome to Show YourShelf!
The application will take you for an adventure which even the least open people will like!
We would like to present you your own Personality Shelves – Agreeableness, Consciousness, Extraversion, Neuroticism and Openness. 
Fill in our test! We would like to take you to different places, face you with various situations and make you wonder about your own reactions and ways of handling the problems. 
But the most incredible part is written not in words, not even in application code. It is written in your own genetic code! With the Genomelink tool you can now get to know your personality (and not only!) straight from your genome! 
Compare the score obtained from your genetics and the score from your everyday behavior! Is it the similar? Maybe your Nervous Shelf is way higher than is should be? Maybe you should check your diet, your health or think about your environment. Or maybe you should fight your shyness? Maybe you will feel better among people? 
And here is the fun part - invite your friends! Let them answer the same questions – about you! Are you ready to get to know how they see you? Are you ready to answer the questions about them?  When you fill the test, you get to see their genetic Shelves. Are they similar to reality?
